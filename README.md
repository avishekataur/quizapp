My First React Native Android App


This is a basic quiz app with a few nice features and functionalities. 
Such as 
<li>React-Native stack navigation for screen routing</li>
<li>Selecting different question categories</li>
<li>Questions with multiple-options</li>
<li>Answer verification</li>
<li>Quiz progress-bar</li>
<li>Scores and Restart Quiz</li> 
</br>
I have used fake JSON data because I have some issues with Open Trivia Api object structure so, I customized my own app data.
