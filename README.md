#QUIZPRO
My First React Native Android App


This is a basic quiz app with a few nice features and functionalities. 
Such as 
React-Native stack navigation for screen routing, 
Selecting different question categories, 
Questions with multiple-options, 
Answer verification
Quiz progress-bar, 
Scores and Restart Quiz. 

I have used fake JSON data because I have some issues with Open Trivia Api object structure so, I customized my own app data.
